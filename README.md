VoteFor is a real-time web application designed to enhance interaction between performers and their audience during live events. It facilitates instant decision-making by allowing crowds to vote on options presented by speakers or performers, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Concept

In large-scale events such as concerts or conferences, interaction is often limited by the size of the audience. VoteFor bridges this gap by providing a digital channel for mass communication. 

For example, a performer can present a set of song choices to the audience. Attendees access the platform via their mobile devices and cast their votes instantly. The results are aggregated in real-time and displayed to the performer, allowing for immediate adaptation of the show's direction based on audience preference.
